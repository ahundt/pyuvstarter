# pyuvstarter

**Tired of tedious Python project setup? `pyuvstarter` is here to streamline your workflow, whether you're starting a new project or modernizing an existing one!**

This script supercharges your Python project initialization by leveraging [`uv`](https://astral.sh/uv) â€“ an extremely fast Python package manager from Astral. `pyuvstarter` automates the creation of a robust, modern Python environment, centered around `pyproject.toml` for dependency management. It's designed to get you coding faster by handling the foundational setup.

**Why should you care?**

* **Speed & Efficiency:** Launch new projects or update existing ones in seconds with `uv`'s blazing-fast environment creation and package operations.
* **Modern Standards:** Automatically sets up your project with `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` for reproducible and reliable dependency management, aligning with current Python best practices.
* **Smart Automation for New & Existing Projects with steps to avoid breaking them:**
    * For existing projects, it can migrate dependencies from legacy `requirements.txt` files into your `pyproject.toml`.
    * Scans your code for imports using [`pipreqs`](https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs) and automatically adds discovered dependencies to `pyproject.toml` via `uv add`.
    * Identifies unused imports using [`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) to help you keep your dependency list clean and efficient.
    * Sets up a `.gitignore` file with sensible defaults.
    * Configures VS Code to use the new project environment.
* **Reproducibility & Auditing:** Generates a detailed JSON log (`pyuvstarter_setup_log.json`) of every action, making troubleshooting and understanding the setup process transparent.
* **Non-Interactive by Default:** Designed for a smooth, "standard run" experience without interrupting you with prompts.

In short, `pyuvstarter` handles the boilerplate, so you can focus on coding, whether it's a brand-new idea or an established codebase.

## Features

* **`uv` Integration:**
    * Ensures `uv` is installed on the system (with platform-aware installation attempts if missing).
    * Uses `uv init` to create or verify a `pyproject.toml` file.
    * Conditionally removes `main.py` if `uv init` creates it in a directory that already contained other Python files, respecting existing project structures.
    * Creates a virtual environment (default: `.venv`) using `uv venv`.
    * Manages dependencies through `pyproject.toml` using `uv add`.
    * Synchronizes the environment with `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` using `uv sync`.
    * Installs necessary CLI tools (like `pipreqs` and `ruff`) using `uv tool install`.
* **Dependency Management:**
    * Treats `pyproject.toml` as the primary source of truth for dependencies.
    * Migrates dependencies from an existing `requirements.txt` file (if present) into `pyproject.toml` using `uv add`. The original `requirements.txt` is left untouched, and the user is advised on its management.
    * Uses [`pipreqs`](https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs) (via `uvx`) to scan project source code for imported packages.
    * Automatically adds newly discovered, undeclared dependencies to `pyproject.toml` using `uv add`.
    *  [`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) provides pre-flight unused import detection** (F401), warning users about potentially unneeded dependencies.
* **IDE & Version Control:**
    * Configures VS Code's Python interpreter path in `.vscode/settings.json` and `.vscode/launch.json`.
    * Ensures a `.gitignore` file exists with common Python, virtual environment, and OS-specific exclusions, also ignoring the script's own JSON log file.
* **Automation & Logging:**
    * Runs non-interactively, making sensible default choices.
    * Generates a detailed `pyuvstarter_setup_log.json` file for traceability and debugging.
    * Provides clear console output and includes "Next Steps" guidance in both console and the JSON log.

## How to Use `pyuvstarter`

### 1. Prerequisites for Running `pyuvstarter`

* **Python 3:** Preferably 3.8+ to run the `pyuvstarter.py` script. Python 3.11+ is recommended for the best experience with `pyproject.toml` parsing using the built-in `tomllib`.
* **`uv`:** `pyuvstarter` will attempt to install `uv` if it's not found on your system. This requires:
    * **macOS:** Homebrew (`brew`) is preferred, or `curl`.
    * **Linux:** `curl`.
    * **Windows:** PowerShell.
* **Git:** If you plan to install `pyuvstarter` itself from a Git repository (see below).

### 2. Installing `pyuvstarter` as a Command-Line Tool (Recommended)

Once this `pyuvstarter` project is available in a public Git repository (e.g., on GitHub), you can install it as a command-line tool using `uv` itself:

1.  **Ensure `uv` is installed on your system.** If not, `pyuvstarter` (when run for the first time on another project) can help install it, or you can install `uv` manually from [astral.sh](https://astral.sh/uv).
2.  **Install `pyuvstarter` using `uv tool install`:**
    ```bash
    uv tool install git+https://github.com/ahundt/pyuvstarter.git
    ```
    For this to work seamlessly and make `pyuvstarter` directly callable, the `pyproject.toml` file within the `pyuvstarter` project should define an entry point for the script, like:
    ```toml
    # In pyuvstarter's own pyproject.toml
    [project.scripts]
    pyuvstarter = "pyuvstarter:main"
    ```
3.  **Ensure `uv`'s tool binaries directory is in your PATH:**
    `uv tool install` places executables in a directory managed by `uv` (often `~/.local/bin` on Linux/macOS or a similar user-specific path). `uv` usually provides instructions to add this to your PATH if it's not already there. You can also run:
    ```bash
    uv tool update-shell
    ```
    Then, restart your terminal or source your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`).

After these steps, you should be able to run `pyuvstarter` from any directory.

**Alternative Installation (from a local clone):**

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
git clone https://github.com/ahundt/pyuvstarter.git
cd pyuvstarter

# 2. Install pyuvstarter as a uv tool
uv tool install .

# 3. (Optional) Force reinstall if you want to overwrite an existing install
uv pip install .
```

**Uninstall pyuvstarter**

```bash
uv tool uninstall pyuvstarter
uv pip uninstall pyuvstarter
```

### 3. Running `pyuvstarter` to Set Up a Project

Once `pyuvstarter` is installed and available in your PATH:

1.  **Navigate to your target project's root directory** (this can be an empty directory for a new project or an existing project you want to set up with `uv`).
2.  **Run the command:**
    ```bash
    pyuvstarter
    ```

The script will then perform all its automated setup actions in that directory.

*(If you haven't installed `pyuvstarter` system-wide, you would place the `pyuvstarter.py` script directly into your target project's root directory, make it executable (`chmod +x pyuvstarter.py` on Linux/macOS), and run it with `./pyuvstarter.py` or `python3 pyuvstarter.py` from within that directory.)*

### Command-Line Arguments

You can run `pyuvstarter` with the following options:

- `pyuvstarter [project_dir]`
  Run setup in the specified `project_dir`. If omitted, uses the current directory.

- `pyuvstarter --version`
  Print the installed version of `pyuvstarter` and exit.

- `--dependency-migration {auto,all-requirements,only-imported,skip-requirements}`
  Strategy for handling `requirements.txt`.
    * `'auto'` (default): Intelligently migrates `requirements.txt` entries only if they are actively imported, and adds all other imported packages. Warns about unused `requirements.txt` entries.
    * `'all-requirements'`: Migrates every single entry from `requirements.txt` as-is, and then adds any additional discovered imported packages.
    * `'only-imported'`: Only migrates `requirements.txt` entries that are actively imported, and adds all other imported packages.
    * `'skip-requirements'`: Ignores `requirements.txt` entirely and relies solely on discovering dependencies from `import` statements.

- `--dry-run`
  Preview all actions without making any changes to the project's files or environment.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Run in the current directory
pyuvstarter

# Run in a specific directory
pyuvstarter /path/to/your/project

# Show version
pyuvstarter --version

# Migrate all requirements.txt entries, even if unused
pyuvstarter --dependency-migration all-requirements

# Perform a dry-run to see what would happen
pyuvstarter --dry-run
```

## Expected Outcome After `pyuvstarter` Runs

* A `pyproject.toml` file will define your project's dependencies.
* A `.gitignore` file will be present.
* A `.venv/` directory will contain the Python virtual environment.
* A `uv.lock` file will ensure reproducible dependency installations.
* Dependencies (migrated, declared, and discovered) will be installed.
* `.vscode/settings.json` and `.vscode/launch.json` will be configured for vscode.
* A `pyuvstarter_setup_log.json` file will detail the script's operations.
* The console output (and the JSON log) will provide "Next Steps" guidance.

## Typical "Next Steps" After Running `pyuvstarter`

1.  **Reload VS Code:** If your project was already open in VS Code, reload the window (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`, then type "Developer: Reload Window").
2.  **Activate Virtual Environment:** In your terminal, activate the virtual environment:
    * Linux/macOS: `source .venv/bin/activate`
    * Windows (PowerShell): `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
3.  **Review & Test:**
    * Examine `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.
    * Review the generated `.gitignore`.
    * Test your project thoroughly.
4.  **Commit to Version Control:**
    * Commit `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `.gitignore`, and your project's source code.
    * If `pyuvstarter` itself is part of this project (not installed globally), commit it too.
    * **Do NOT commit** `.venv/` or `pyuvstarter_setup_log.json`.

## Troubleshooting

* If `uv` or `pipreqs`/`ruff` installation (done by `pyuvstarter`) fails, the script will provide error messages and hints.
* If `pipreqs` misidentifies dependencies, manually edit `pyproject.toml` and use `uv add <correct-package>` or `uv remove <incorrect-package>`, then `uv sync`.
* Always check `pyuvstarter_setup_log.json` for detailed error messages.
